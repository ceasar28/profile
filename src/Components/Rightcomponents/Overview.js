      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p>
        I am a junior software developer at Foxy Labs Technology Limited, with a
        keen interest in the technology-driven world of possibilities. I am
        effective at learning and working on tech-related projects, which has
        helped me gain experience in various fields. I have worked as an
        Embedded Software Engineering Intern at the Scientific Equipment
        Development Institute (SEDI) and Buchi West Agro Allied Services, where
        I wrote codes for arduino embedded systems and raspberry pi for
        automating food processing machines, developed a software for relay
        switch control of a grinding machine, and developed an IoT monitoring
        software for a tomatoes Hydroponics system.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical and Production
        Engineering from Enugu State University of Science and Technology, and a
        West African Senior School Certificate in Science from Federal
        Government College Enugu. I have skills in Shell, Javascript, HTML, CSS,
        Python, C++, Matlab Analysis, SQL, NoSQL (Mongodb), leadership,
        teamwork, and learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also been involved in various volunteer works such as developing
        an attendance management Web app using node.js, express.js, EJS
        (template) and Mongodb as part of National Youth Service Corps Community
        Development service, designing and programming a hydroponics tomato
        watering and security system (IOT) using C++ and arduino as part of
        ENACTUS student competition, and collaborating with a team of four to
        develop a result computational software for school result computations
        as part of ENACTUS student competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests include software development, robotic and automation,
        machine learning, and blockchain technology.
